# Orders API project

## Purpose

This project was an introduction to Swagger and OpenAPI. In this project I was able to use [Swagger editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor) to help build a simple orders API. I used Swagger editor and Swagger UI along with Expressjs to practice creating a simple API. This project also taught me about YAML and the metadata that is required to help construct a useful API. This project was part of the [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) full-stack engineering course.
